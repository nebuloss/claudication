// Mostly the chart library's arithmetic, because geometry is the part of a
// chart that can be silently wrong: one with a bad scale still draws, it just
// lies. This caught exactly that — niceTicks used to return a top gridline
// *below* the data for some maxima, which draws a column taller than the plot
// and out through the top of the chart.
//
// And now the routing, for the same reason in a different shape: a URL that
// parses to the wrong tab still renders a screen, just not the one the link
// asked for.
//
// `make test-web` compiles the pure modules and runs this. Only the pure ones:
// the React components need a DOM, and a headless browser to check that a rect
// landed where the scale said it would is a great deal of machinery to re-test
// arithmetic that is already checked here.
